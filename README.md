Old Spotify 'Mini-Clone' project I started working on months back, now finished (version 1). 

## Basic features:

- Spotify Login with Next Auth (Persistant auth)
- Fetch account playlists
- View account playlist metadata (Songs, Info, Artists, Duration)
- Fetch currently playing song
- Spotify UI w/ Footer (Clicking on a song will change the playback status for Spotify Premium users)
- Home page (View recently played, featured playlists, new releases)
- Search page (Search by playlist, track, or artist)
- Create/Delete playlist
